# Deploying Your React Website

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy your React website to your hosting service.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- A React project created using Create React App or another method
- Access to your hosting service's dashboard or FTP credentials

## Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Build Your React App

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your React project directory using `cd path/to/your/project`.
3. Run the following command to build your React app:


This command bundles your React app into static files for production.

### Step 2: Prepare for Deployment

1. After the build process completes, you'll see a `build` folder in your project's root directory.
2. This folder contains the optimized production build of your React app.

### Step 3: Deploy Using FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

1. Open an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP).
2. Connect to your hosting service using the provided FTP credentials (hostname, username, password).
3. Navigate to the root directory of your hosting service where you want to deploy your React app.
4. Upload all the contents of the `build` folder (from your local machine) to the remote directory on your hosting server.
5. Wait for the files to finish uploading.

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. Once the upload is complete, visit your domain name in a web browser.
2. Your React app should now be live and accessible to visitors.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Configuration:** Ensure your hosting service supports serving static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Domain Setup:** If your domain is not pointing to the hosting service yet, update the DNS settings accordingly.
- **HTTPS:** Consider enabling HTTPS for secure communication between your visitors and your website. Most hosting services provide SSL certificates or support for Let's Encrypt.
